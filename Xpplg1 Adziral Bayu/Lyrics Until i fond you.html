        I want you in my arms<br>
        
        Oh, let me hold you<br>
        
        I'll never let you go again like I did<br>
        
        Oh, I used to say<br>
            <br>
            
        I would never fall in love again until I found her<br>
        
        I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"<br>
        
        I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her<br>
        
        I found you<br>
        <br>
        

        Georgia pulled me in, I asked to<br>
        
        Love her once again<br>
        
        You fell, I caught you<br>
        
        I'll never let you go again like I did<br>
        
        Oh, I used to say<br>
            <br>
            
        I would never fall in love again until I found her<br>
        
        I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"<br>
        
        I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her<br>
        
        I found you<br>
            <br>
            
        I would never fall in love again until I found her<br>
        
        I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"<br>
        
        I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her<br>
        
        I found you
